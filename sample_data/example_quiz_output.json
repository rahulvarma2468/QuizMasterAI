    {
      "question": "What is the primary goal of Artificial Intelligence?",
      "options": [
        "To replace human workers entirely",
        "To simulate human intelligence in machines",
        "To create sentient robots",
        "To build faster computers"
      ],
      "answer": "To simulate human intelligence in machines",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "AI's primary goal is to create systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving."

      "question": "Which of the following is a subfield of AI?",
      "options": [
        "Quantum mechanics",
        "Machine learning",
        "Thermodynamics",
        "Organic chemistry"
      ],
      "answer": "Machine learning",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "explanation": "Machine learning is a core subfield of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."

      "question": "What year is often considered the birth of AI as a field?",
      "options": [
        "1936",
        "1950",
        "1956",
        "1980"
      ],
      "answer": "1956",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "The 1956 Dartmouth Conference is widely considered the birthplace of AI as a field of study, where the term 'artificial intelligence' was coined."

    {
      "question": "What is the Turing Test designed to evaluate?",
      "options": [
        "A machine's ability to perform mathematical calculations",
        "A machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human",
        "A machine's processing speed",
        "A machine's memory capacity"
      ],
      "answer": "A machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing, evaluates whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human."

    {
      "question": "What is 'narrow AI' also known as?",
      "options": [
        "General AI",
        "Super AI",
        "Weak AI",
        "Strong AI"
      ],
      "answer": "Weak AI",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Narrow AI, also called Weak AI, refers to AI systems designed to perform specific tasks, as opposed to general AI which would have broad human-like intelligence."
